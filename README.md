English Premier League Function

This is an R function goes to the website http://www.football-data.co.uk and grabs the data on a specified season up to a specified date for every match in the English Premier League. 
The function calculates what team is currently leading the league. It sorts any ties based off of points per match, then points, then by goals and lastly by fewest goals allowed.
This project is useful since it can calculate who was leading a season at any given date, not just at the end of the season.
The function also returns useful values like the streak the team is on currently, the record in the last 10 games, home record, and away record.
